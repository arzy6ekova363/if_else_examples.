        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Alina, and I am a student at Gymnasium Boarding School No.1. 
            I am 15 years old, and I live in Kyrgyzstan. In this project, I want to tell you all about my school, 
            why I love it, and how it helps me learn and grow.
        </p>

        <h2>About My School</h2>
        <p>
            My school is one of the most beautiful and well-known schools in our city. 
            The building is large, with two floors, many classrooms, a sports hall, a library, and a computer lab. 
            We also have a school yard where students can relax or play during breaks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every morning, students line up outside for the national anthem. Then we go to our classes, 
            which usually start at 8:00 AM and finish at 2:00 PM. Each lesson lasts 45 minutes. 
            We study many different subjects such as Math, English, History, Geography, and Informatics.
        </p>

        <h2>Teachers and Lessons</h2>
        <p>
            Our teachers are very kind and intelligent. They always help us understand difficult topics. 
            My favorite teacher is Ms. Asylkhan Abdieva. She teaches Informatics. Her lessons are very interesting, 
            and she uses the computer to show us how technology works. She is always patient and explains everything clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also enjoy English classes because I love learning new words and practicing speaking. 
            Our English teacher encourages us to speak, read, and write in English, which helps me feel more confident.
        </p>

        <h2>My Favorite Subjects</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite subjects are English and Informatics. I enjoy English because it is an international language, 
            and I want to travel the world and talk to people from other countries. Informatics is also very exciting because 
            I want to become a programmer in the future. I love working with computers and learning new things every day.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>School Life</h2>
        <p>
            School life is not only about lessons. We also have fun events, celebrations, and competitions. 
            Sometimes we have concerts, where students sing songs, dance, and perform. We also take part in math olympiads 
            and sports tournaments. I love being a part of these activities because they help me build confidence and enjoy school more.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have many friends at school. We study together, help each other with homework, and have fun during breaks. 
            My best friend and I sit together in class and share ideas. School is a place where I feel safe, happy, and motivated.

            I am proud to be a student of Gymnasium Boarding School No.1. I will always remember my teachers, my classmates,
