    <h1>The Human Digestive System</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The digestive system is one of the most important systems in the human body. It helps us break down the food we eat 
            and absorb nutrients to give us energy. Without digestion, our bodies cannot function properly. In this project, 
            I will explain how the digestive system works and describe its main organs.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Main Organs of the Digestive System</h2>
        <p>
            The digestive system includes several organs that work together. These organs are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mouth</strong> – where digestion begins. Teeth chew food and saliva starts to break it down.</li>
            <li><strong>Esophagus</strong> – a tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.</li>
            <li><strong>Stomach</strong> – where food is mixed with digestive juices and broken into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Small Intestine</strong> – the main place where nutrients are absorbed into the blood.</li>
            <li><strong>Large Intestine</strong> – absorbs water and forms waste (feces).</li>
            <li><strong>Liver</strong> – produces bile that helps digest fats.</li>
            <li><strong>Pancreas</strong> – makes enzymes that help digest proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>How Digestion Works</h2>
        <p>
            Digestion starts in the mouth when we chew food and mix it with saliva. Then, the food goes down the esophagus 
            to the stomach. In the stomach, strong acids and enzymes break it down even more. Next, the food moves into the 
            small intestine, where the liver and pancreas send juices to help with digestion. Nutrients are absorbed into the blood here.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, the remaining food goes to the large intestine. Water is absorbed, and the leftover waste is turned into 
            feces, which leaves the body through the rectum.
        </p>

        <h2>Why It’s Important</h2>
        <p>
            The digestive system is essential for our health. It gives us the energy and nutrients we need to grow, move, think, 
            and stay healthy. Problems with digestion can cause stomach pain, poor nutrition, or illness.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion, the human digestive system is a complex and amazing process. Each organ has a special job, 
            and they all work together to keep us alive and healthy. That’s why we should eat healthy foods, drink water, 
            and take care of our digestive health.
